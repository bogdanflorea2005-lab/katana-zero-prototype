This project is a prototype of katana zero, a game created by Askiisoft.

For now, I have the Entity, Player, Enemy and Tile classes mostly in place.

To do:
I need to further add a way to load pre-generated rooms, a functioning camera, a way to go between said rooms, a more efficient way of checking collision between tiles and entities, more complex AI for enemies, more player controls(such as an attack, a way to interact with other bojects, etc.) and and many other things. (and spries and animations, but the art director is lazy)
