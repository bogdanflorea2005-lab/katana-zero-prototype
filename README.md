This project is a prototype of katana zero, a game created by Askiisoft.

To do:
I need to further add a way to go between rooms, a more efficient way of checking collision between tiles and entities, more complex AI for enemies, more player controls(such as an attack, a way to interact with other bojects, etc.) and and many other things. (and spries and animations, but the art team is lazy)
